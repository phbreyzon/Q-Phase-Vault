### The world is becoming more insecure

In the article titled "The world is becoming more insecure" published by Clemens Wergin in the Newspaper Die Welt on November 22, 2008, it is mentioned that every four years, the US intelligence agencies present the newly elected president with "global trends" that outline America's position in the world and the challenges of the coming decades. The good news are that, al-Qaida will disappear faster than some might think. The bad news is that America's global dominance will fade, although it will remain the most important player.

Additionally it warns against celebrating the new multipolar world, as it suggests that a world with multiple power centers will be more unstable than one with one or two superpowers. A possible consequence, is a scenario reminiscent of the 19th century with arms races, territorial expansion, and military conflicts.

Furthermore addresses the perception of America's decline, stating that while there may be a relative devaluation of the USA due to the economic rise of countries like Brazil, China, and India, there is no one in sight who could replace America's role. However, as America weakens, the world becomes more uncertain. Therefore, it is in the interest of many to strengthen America's leadership.
