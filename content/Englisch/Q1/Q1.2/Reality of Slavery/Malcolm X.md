While Malcolm X played a significant role in the Civil Rights Movement, I disagree with his approach to handling the issues faced by African Americans today. Malcolm X's endorsement of violence as a means of achieving justice is problematic. Non-violence, as practiced by leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., has proven to be more effective in creating lasting change.

Additionally, Malcolm X's advocacy for racial segregation and the creation of a separate African American nation could have resulted in further division. Integration promotes unity and understanding between different racial and ethnic groups.

Furthermore, Malcolm X's rhetoric perpetuated a sense of victimhood among African Americans. While acknowledging historical injustices is crucial, it is equally important to empower the community and promote self-determination. By emphasizing self-reliance, education, and economic prosperity, we can work towards breaking down systemic barriers and creating a more equitable society.

In conclusion, Malcolm X's approach of violence, separatism, and fostering a victim mentality is not conducive to addressing the issues faced by the African American community today. Non-violence, integration, and empowerment provide a more constructive path towards achieving justice and equality for all.
