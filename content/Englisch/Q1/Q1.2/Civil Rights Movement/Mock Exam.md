## The text 

SITTING IN a church service several years back, listening to his pastor speak of the obligation to confront what is wrong in society, Branville G. Bard Jr. thought about being a Black man anda top police official too. “I know some of you think you're helping,” Bard recalled his pastor telling parishioners. “But you can’t actually help and be silent.” That remark moved Bard to confront openly what he consid- ~ ered an agonizing truth: He was part of a system “built on oppression and, structurally, on racism,” he said. “Not to acknowledge that means a failure to acknowledge the past,” said Bard, who became the police commissioner in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2017. “Folks are just going to continue to resent your failure to acknowledge that.”
As police chiefs struggle to reform their departments amid a national reckoning over police abuse, those African-American officers who have risen to the top say they face particular challenges. The expectations they face are outsized, coming from those chanting “Black lives matter!” as well as those subbing out the word Black for blue. Some Black chiefs have had negative interactions with police officers while out of uniform, and they are expected to smooth out tensions between Black residents angry at the police and officers who recoil at the suggestion that they harbor racial bias. The chiefs are lauded for trying to change the system but also knocked as traitors by some of those in blue and in the communities they come from. Some chiefs have knelt with protesters, but they have also overseen officers deploying tear gas at demonstrations. 
“You feel something, as an African-American male, that there's extra pressure on you to somehow wave a magic wand and you can make some of the things go away,” said Kenton Buckner, who became the police chief of Syracuse, New York, in late 2018. “A chief is every day walking a tightrope of trying to please his appointing authority, Police Department, and the community, and treat them all as your wives,” he added. “And they’re all extremely jealous of each other, but you have to walk that tightrope each day to make sure that you're in line with all three of them.”
The precarious nature of being a Black chief in this moment was apparent in recent days when the leaders of two departments announced they would step down, Chief U. Reneé Hall of Dallas said she would leave the force in November after receiving heavy criticism for her officers’ response this summer to protests against racism in policing, And Chief La’Ron D. Singletary of Rochester, New York, joined his entire command in stepping down amid intense backlash over his handling of the death of a Black man in police custody in March.
Through lived experience, Black leaders in law enforcement can sometimes bring an understanding of the nuances of community tensions with the police, Bard, who wrote his doctoral dissertation on racial profiling in policing, is rolling out a record- keeping system in his department that will allow it to keep detailed data on police stops and analyze whether racial bias is a factor.
Donny Williams, a native of Wilmington, North Carolina, who became that city’s police chief this year, said he tried to limit the number of officers who showed up to calls. He attrib- uted that goal to a sentiment he heard coming up in a Black neighborhood, where people would complain of “carloads” of police officers showing up in their communities. When 10 officers respond to a traffic stop in which four would suffice, that can seem like Over-policing, he said. His friends and family still have “brutally honest conversations” with him about their issues with the police, he said. “That’s one of the things that I can see from the perspective, especially of the Black community; it looks like we just come in as a military force in the Black community,” Williams said.
This moment seems to have increased the demand for Black leadership in law enforcement. After just a few months on the job, the white police chief in Port- land, Oregon, stepped down in June and handed over the reins to Chuck Lovell, a Black veteran of the department known for his deep community ties. “Part of it is Tepresentation, who’s at the table, who’s there when decisions are being made,” Lovell said. “One of the things that’s helpful being a Black chief is you can have some different conversations with folks in the Black community. There’s a feeling that you can be a little more honest.” In Louisville, Kentucky, where the killing of Breonna Taylor in a police raid has sparked unrest, the mayor appointed Yvette Gentry, a Black woman and former deputy chief, as the interim chief of the department. In an emotional address during her introduction, Gentry spoke of the need for broad systemic changes in racial equity across the board, not just policing. _ ‘She told a story of her son moving into a neighborhood only to have neighbors call in drug dealer complaints against him days later. “I served 20-something years willing to die for a city that wouldn’t even make my son feel welcome”, she said during the news conference. “Our city is going to crumble if we don’t start telling truths.”

### Nr.1 

In the New York Times article “Black police chiefs face criticism on all sides”, written by John Eligon, in a church service he had attended, chief officer Branville G. Bard Jr. became aware of the fact, that problems concerning racism in the US are not going to be solved by the police unless somebody speaks up on the fact that the state and its institutions are build on an oppresive foundation that is at the core racist. Branville realizes that by not acknowledging that, people are going to resent him as a policeman while doing his job.

### Nr.2 

Black police chiefs are under constant pressure to meet the needs of their appointing authorities, the Police Deparnment and their community at the same time. The metaphor “walking a tightrope” describes the struggle those police officers face while trying to satisfie all parties at the same time, although they sometimes have opposing interests.

### Possible solution 

**I. Comprehension: (30 BE)**

1. Branville G. Bard Jr. realized the truth that he was part of a system "built on oppression and, structurally, on racism". This acknowledgment stemmed from his experience in a church service where his pastor emphasized the importance of not remaining silent when confronting what is wrong in society.

2. Black police chiefs face the challenges of reforming their departments amid national scrutiny over police abuse while dealing with heightened expectations from various groups. The metaphor "walking a tightrope" used by Chief Kenton Buckner illustrates the delicate balance these chiefs must maintain between satisfying the demands of their appointing authority, the police department, and the community. Each of these entities has its own interests and expectations, often conflicting, making the chief's job exceedingly difficult, akin to the careful and precarious balance required when walking on a tightrope.

3. The main prejudices highlighted in the article are that Black communities might view the police as an oppressive force due to experiences of being over-policed and racial bias, while some in the white population may harbor racial biases that manifest in actions such as lodging unfounded complaints against Black individuals, as in the case of Yvette Gentry's son.

**II. Analysis:**

The issues presented in the article relate to the broader movement for racial equality and police reform in America. The Black Lives Matter movement, which gained momentum after several high-profile cases of police brutality against Black individuals, is a contemporary iteration of America's long-standing struggle for civil rights. This movement has pushed for systemic change, challenging institutional racism and advocating for social justice reforms. The demand for Black leadership in law enforcement, as seen in the examples provided in the text, is a response to the community's need for representation and understanding within the system. These issues are conditioned by a history of racial inequality in America, and each movement influences the other by highlighting the need for societal and systemic changes to address deep-rooted biases and discrimination.

**III. Discussion: (30BE)**

The Black Lives Matter movement can indeed be seen as a new American civil rights movement. It addresses systemic racism, police brutality, and racial inequality, much like the civil rights movements of the past. However, there are key differences in terms of the methods used, such as the prominent role of digital activism and social media in mobilizing supporters. Furthermore, the Black Lives Matter movement operates in a different societal and technological context, characterized by a more diverse and interconnected global community. While the 1960s civil rights movement focused on dismantling legalized racial segregation and discrimination, the Black Lives Matter movement extends the fight to include a broader range of issues such as mass incarceration and economic inequality. Despite these differences, both movements seek to realize the promise of equal rights and justice for all, making Black Lives Matter a continuation of the civil rights legacy in a modern context.
