###  The American people moves out of the crisis (as they have always done)
Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our union moves forward. It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression, the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that while each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family, and we rise or fall together as one nation and as one  people.


### Hopes and achievements as a community
Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States of America, the best is yet to come. Despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America's future.

### education
We want our kids to grow up in a country where they have access to the best schools and the best teachers - a country that lives up to its legacy as the global leader in technology and discovery and innovation - with all of the good jobs and new businesses that follow.

### America tackles social, financial and environmental problems
 We want our children to live in an America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened up by inequality, that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet.

### Military  and manifest destinity provide peace
We want to pass on a country that's safe and respected and admired around the world, a nation that is defended by the strongest military on Earth and the best troops this - this world has ever known - but also a country that moves with confidence beyond this time of war to shape a peace that is built on the promise of freedom and dignity for every human being.

### The American Dream is alive
We believe in a generous America, in a compassionate America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag. That's the future we hope for. That's the vision we share. That's where we need to go - forward. That's where we need to go.

### individualism and pursuit of happiness

America, I believe we can build on the progress we've made and continue to fight for new jobs and new opportunities and new security for the middle class. I believe we can keep the promise of our founders, the idea that if you're willing to work hard, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like or who you love. It doesn't matter whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or  poor, abled or disabled, gay or straight. You can make it here in America if you're willing to try.

#### Main Message: The United States are moving forward to perfection
