The extract of the speech delivered by Barack Obama on the 4th of November 2008 at his election night victory in Grant Park, Illinois, is a speech that served Barack Obama as an opportunity to thank his supporters, what lies ahead of them and most of all, that they are capable of of overcome the odds.

The speech can be divided into two main parts. 

In the first part (ll. 1-19) Obama starts with an announce to his opposition who still doubts his success in the election without mentioning he actually succeeded (ll. 1-4 ), which sets the expectations high for the audience to what comes next.
Then he explains that his election victory, which he elegantly rephrases  as “the answer”, was made possible because of the voice of his supporters. 
Hereby, he uses a parallel structure (ll. 5, 10, 15 “It’s the answer… ”) as well as specific enumeration of the different institutions (l. 5) and different ethnic, social and political groups (l-.10), that supported Obama’s election, which puts emphasis on the inclusiveness of his politics, where even his opposition (l. 11“the Republicans”) is included. Obama reinforces that point further by pointing out that it were the Americans who voted for a “United States of America” (Obama’s politics) rather than for a collection of divided “Red States and Blue States” (l.14). Furthermore he creates a sense of unity by addressing the audience as “we”.
In addition to that, he motivates his supporters further by expressing the hard journey of his electors towards the point of his victory and that their endurance is now being rewarded (l. 15-17). 
Here, he purposefully uses a metaphorical approach to describe the achievement of his success (l. 16-17)
in order to portray a sense of a bigger meaning .

The next paragraph (l. 19- 21) serves as a conclusion to the first part and introduces the second part using a climax, that strongly emphasises the impact his election has.

In the second part Obama explains that while progress has been made, there is still a lot that needs to be done in order to ensure that the next generation can proudly look back at the progress been made. By using rhetorical questions (ll. 24-5) he actively engages the audience to think about their own descendants. Additionally, it’s important to note is that he now adresses the audience as “America”, making the electors a part to of the bigger picture.  

Obama then expresses that it is the audience’s chance to answer to those calls coming from future generations, linking the rephrase “answer” used at the beginning, to the future. By using parallel structures (l. 27) he puts emphasis on his vision of changes that need to be done, focusing on tackling social inequality, ensuring peace within the country, and reclaiming the American Dream’s fundamental truth, which he defines as the unity of the country ( ll.31- 33“that out of many, we are one, that while we breathe… ”).    
 
Finnally he ends the speech by connecting the “answer” at the beginning with his campaign slogan, which leaves the impression of a well crafted speech.
