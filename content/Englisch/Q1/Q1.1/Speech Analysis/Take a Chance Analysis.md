## Analyzing the speech

The extract speech titled “Take a Chance” delivered by Barack Obama on June the second 2006 at the University of Massachusetts Boston and geared towards its students, is a speech that very effectively conveys the message of persevering America and its characteristics. Tailored specifically to graduate students Obama also gives advice, coming from his own life, on the students upcoming joining the work force.


To support his point, Obama mentions the progress that has been made, such as the increasing number of first-generation college students and the diverse present at the university (l. 18 - 27). He acknowledges that while progress has been made, there is still more work to be done in terms of justice and breaking down barriers. And so he calls upon the students' generation, which have been enabled to successfully study and graduate because of those prior efforts in the first place, to bring about the necessary changes (l. 18 - 31). His clever use of parallel constructed sentences (In the most …, I look out… I see students…) gives a certain sense of rhythm and harmony to what he says, making it more positively connoted than it would have been otherwise.

Obama then discusses the challenges that the current century presented, particularly in a globalized world where communication and technology have broken down barriers (l. 32 - 39). He emphasizes the need to adapt and not take for granted assumptions about education, job security, and specifically national security.  
Important to point out is hereby the fact that the last point was crafted with an unusual inverted sentence, that puts emphasis on that specific point, which for Obama is very important since it strongly supports his anti-terrorism politics (l.43-44). 

In terms of the students' role in meeting these challenges, Obama suggests taking risks and following one's passions. He shares his personal experience of deciding to become a community organizer instead of pursuing a more conventional path, which is a common dilemma that many students face after graduating. 
Despite advice from others, he chose to follow his own calling and try for something bigger. Obama encourages the students to listen to themselves and decide what they care deeply about, even if it means risking everything.


Overall, Obama's speech analysis reflects his intention to inspire the graduating students to preserve the characteristics of America by taking risks, pursuing their passions, and working towards positive change. By elegantly making use of personal pronounce, parallel structures and attention grabbing sentences he engages the audience and motivates them to take a chance themselves.
