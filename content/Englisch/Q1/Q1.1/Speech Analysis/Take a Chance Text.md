## The speech

> Thefollowing extract is taken from the Commencement Address given by Barack Obama at the university of Massachusetts Boston on 2 June 2006


 America is an unlikely place -it's a country built on defiance of the odds; on a belief in the impossible. And I remind you of this because as you set off on your s own lives of success and achievement, it's now your turn to help keep it this way. It's your turn to keep this daringly is notion radical but unfailingly simple  notion of America alive - that no matter where you're born or how much your parents have; no matter what you look like or what you believe in, you can still rise to become whatever you want; still go on to achieve great things; still pursue the happiness that you hope for. Now, there may be some who doubt that much has changed - those who doubt is that things are better today than they were yesterday. For those who believe that, take a look at this class of 2006. More than half represent the very first members of their family ever to attend college. In the most diverse university in New England, I look out at a sea of faces that are African-American and Hispanic-American and Asian-American and Arab-american can and Anglo-American. I see students who've come here from over too different countries, believing like those first settlers that they too could find a home in that T City on a Hill - that they too could find success in the unlikeliest of places. All this has occurred in the midst of a city where No Irish Need Apply signs once hung from stores. All of this in a city where, just thirty years ago, buses of black students were pelted with rocks as they pulled into schools in South Boston, where the 11. Red Sox were once the team who refused to sign the great Jackie Robinson. But the problem isn't that we haven't made progress - we have. The problem is 1 that the progress still isn't good enough. There is more work to be done, more justice: to be had, there are more barriers to break down. And now it's your generation's to bring those changes about. The last century was undoubtedly the American century. Our victory Fascism and Communism liberated millions. At home, we built a shared prosper that created the largest middle-class in history. Ours was a nation of liberators Of people; of prosperous people - and the world took notice. t. But today, just a few years into the twenty-first century, we've already found selves in a different and sometimes precarious m position. As revolutions in communication and technology have broken down barriers across the world, it's more power to both our competitors and to our enemies. No longer can we assume that a high-school education in Boston is enough to compete for a job that can easily go to the college educated in Bangalore, or in Beijing. No more can we count on employers to job training when their bottom lines know no borders to provide health care and pensions and job training. Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil.

A So what does this mean for you? What role will you play in meeting these challenges? I do not pretend to have all the answers. Each of you are going to so have to discover those on your own. But perhaps I can offer a few suggestions that may be useful along the way.  First: take risks … When I was on the brink of graduating from college, I had this crazy idea that I wanted to be a community organizer and work in low-income neighbourhoods. u. My mother and grandparents thought that l should go to law school, and my friends, they were all busy applying for jobs on Wall Street. But I went ahead and I cs wrote, it must have been 200 letters, to every organization in the country that I thought was trying to do something good in their neighborhoods. And finally, there was this small group of churches on the south side of Chicago who wrote back and offered me a job helping them deal with the consequences of steel plants that had closed and put thousands out of work. The churches didn't have a lot of money - so they offered me the grand sum of 10 000 a year and 1000 car expense. So I bought an old beat-up car for 800, and I packed up my belongings. and I got out a map. and I started driving west to Chicago - a place where I had never been and where I didn't know a single living soul. , And about halfway between New York City and Chicago. I stopped for the night at a small town in Pennsylvania whose name I can't remember anymore. I found a motel that looked cheap and clean.] pulled into the driveway and went to the counter. Where there was this old guy doing crossword puzzles. I asked him for a room, and as he was filling out the information, he looked up, and he asked me where I was so headed. I explained to him, I was going to Chicago, because I was going to be a community organizer. LI And he said to me. 'You know, you look like a nice clean-cut young man, and you've got a nice voice,' he said. 'So let me give you a piece of advice forget about this community organizing business. You cannot change the world, and people will not appreciate you trying. What you should do is go into is television broadcasting. I am telling you, you can make a name for yourself there.' Now, I could have taken my mother's advice and I could have taken my grand-parents' advice. I could have followed the same path that my friends were traveling. I could have taken the words of wisdom from that old man in Pennsylvania. Objectively speaking, he made some sense. But I knew that there was something in me that wanted to try for something bigger. So don't let people talk you nut of doing what you think is that bigger thing. Listen to what's in you. Decide what you care so much about that you are willing to risk everything for.
