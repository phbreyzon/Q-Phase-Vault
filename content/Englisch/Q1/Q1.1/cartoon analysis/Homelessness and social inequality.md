### 1. What view does the author take on inequality and social mobility in the US?

The author appears to take a critical view on inequality and social mobility. On the left side of the cartoon, labelled "1," we see a multi-tiered bed with individuals who are comfortably resting or engaging in leisurely activities, representing the wealthy and those with social privileges.

They are placed high above others, suggesting that they are out of reach and disconnected from the struggles faced by those below them. Namely the working class in the middle and the poorest on the lowest stage
The characters on top of the bed seem unconcerned with the plight of those on the street level, further emphasizing the disconnection between socioeconomic classes.




On the second cartoon, labeled "2," we see a tent city representing homelessness. This contrast between the opulent bed and the tents on the ground illustrates a significant gap in social mobility and implies that climbing the social ladder from homelessness to affluence is extremely difficult, if not impossible. 


2. State various problems underlying homelessness.

The cartoon identifies multiple underlying problems contributing to homelessness, represented by the arrows pointing to the tent city:

- **Drug addiction**: Substance abuse can lead to financial instability and loss of housing.
- **Mental illness**: Untreated mental health issues can make maintaining employment and housing challenging.
- **Assistance cut**: Reductions in social services and government assistance can leave vulnerable individuals without support.
- **PTSD**: Post-traumatic stress disorder, often associated with veterans or victims of violence, can lead to difficulties in adapting to normal life, which might cause homelessness.
- **Domestic violence**: People often flee from abusive situations without a place to go, leading to homelessness.
- **Income inequality**: A significant wealth gap can make it hard for low-income individuals to afford housing.
- **LGBTQ family rejection**: Individuals who are rejected by their families due to their LGBTQ status may become homeless.
- **Alcoholism**: Like drug addiction, alcoholism can consume resources and destabilize living situations.
- **Student debt**: Large sums of debt can prevent young adults from being able to afford their own housing.

The speech bubble in the cartoon, which reads "If only the homeless problem was about only being homeless," suggests that homelessness is a complex issue interwoven with many other social and personal problems, and not simply a matter of lacking a physical home. This statement underscores the multiplicity of factors contributing to the homelessness crisis.
