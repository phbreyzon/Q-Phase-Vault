The cartoon published by Steven Breen on the 2nd November 2020 at the San Diego-Union Tribune is a coloured digitally drawn cartoon that deals with the presidential elections in the United States. In more detail about the two most popular candidates, namely being Joe Biden the candidate of the Democratic Party and Donald Trump for the Republicans, and the decisions Americans faced at the time.

The cartoon presents a blank brick wall at the centre, which reaches from left to right of the picture. The ground is also visible and is kept relatively simple and unnoticeable in terms of detail and colour choice. Relatively centred on the brick wall are two painted words, “America” on the left side and “United States” on the right side, whereby the words “States” is written under “United” instead of being in one line.  Each of them are written with black colour while leaving two letters in yellow. In the word “America” those are “ME” and in “United States” those are “US”. 

Under each of the words respectively stands one person with their backs facing the wall. Under “America” being a man with a black suit, red tie, tanned skin, blond hair and a rather bulkier physique who should clearly represent Donald Trump.
And under “United States” being it another man with a black suit as well, but with a blue tie instead of red, white skin and an overall slimmer physique which should represent Joe Biden. 
The words under which Joe Biden and Trump are located gives away that one word should belong to a candidate.

Both Joe Biden and Trump are holding a paint roller on a stick with black colour on them. On to the left of each of them, there are both a yellow and a white bucket. Those signs indicate that they were the ones who painted the letters in their colour. 

From distance a man with a white beard, white skin, and glasses, wearing a blue suit and a hat in white, blue and red stripes, with accents of white stars, points with his finger at Joe Biden, as if he had to choose between the two. Over him is a speech bubble saying “That one”, signalizing that he made his decision final. The colour scheme and the motives of the white starts in blue as well as the stripes in red suggests that the man is Uncle Sam. 

In the political context at the time of the creation of the cartoon Uncle Sam might epitomize the will of the American people, since the figure of Uncle Sam has often been used by American media throughout history to symbolize patriotism, national identity, and the American people. In this particular case the will of the American people have decided on Joe Biden as their preferred candidate.   

The cartoonist delivers the explanation of Uncle Sam’s choice by contrasting the core believes of each of the candidates regarding the US, with the help of a visual metaphor, consisting of the black letters on the wall as well as their yellow painted words. 

The word corresponding to Trump “America” has the highlighted word “ME”, which can be interpreted as the personal pronoun ‘me’. That interpretation can be trasnferred to Joe Biden’s “United States” and ‘us’ as well. And if done so, the visual metaphor translates Donald Trump’s political point of view on the US, as one that only sees himself as America itself, as her only true representative, which connotates his belief as selfish, unsympathetic, arrogant and overall negative.

On the contrary Joe Biden’s point of view translates into one that not only recognizes himself but also the American people, as the ones who represent their country, since the word ‘us’ includes more than a single individual, giving his believe a solidaric and overall more positive connotation.

In the face of this extreme contrast Uncle Sams decides himself for the option, the cartoonist portrays to be the best for the people, namely the decision for a solidarity president instead of the selfish one. 


## Version 2

The cartoon by Steven Breen published on November 2, 2020, in the San Diego-Union Tribune deals with the US presidential elections of the same year and features two main candidates, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and the choices faced by Americans. 

It shows a brick wall in the center, with the words "America" and "United States" painted on it. Each word has two letters highlighted in yellow: "ME" in "America" and "US" in "United States." Under each word stands a person representing the respective candidate.

Trump is depicted as a man in a black suit with a red tie under the word “America”, while Biden is shown as a man in a black suit with a blue tie under “United States”.

Both candidates are holding paint rollers covered in black paint, suggesting they painted the letters. There are also yellow and white buckets nearby, indicating their involvement in the painting process. 

A man resembling Uncle Sam, with white hair and a blue suit and a hat adorned with white stars and red stripes, points at Biden, signifying his choice. A speech bubble above Uncle Sam says "That one" indicating his final decision. 

In this case Uncle Sam symbolizes the will of the American people, as he has historically represented patriotism and national identity by American media.

In order to deliver the explanation of Uncle Sam’s decision, the cartoonist uses visual metaphors which contrast the candidates' beliefs about the US. 
The highlighted letters in Trump's "America", namely “me”, imply a self-centered perspective, with Trump seeing himself as the sole representative of the country. 
Conversely, Biden's word "United States" includes the pronoun "us," suggesting a more inclusive and empathetic view.
And so in light of this contrast, Uncle Sam chooses Biden as the candidate who represents solidarity and the best interests of the people.

In conclusion, the message of the cartoon is to highlight the contrasting views of Joe Biden and Donald Trump on the United States. It emphasizes Biden's inclusive and empathetic perspective, symbolized by the word "United States" and the pronoun "us," while portraying Trump's self-centered approach, represented by the word "America" and the pronoun "me." 
The cartoon effectively conveys its message by using visual metaphors, such as the highlighted letters and the paint rollers, to illustrate the candidates' beliefs. 
The pictorial presentation is convincing, as it clearly shows the contrast between the candidates and effectively conveys the message of choosing a solidarity president over a selfish one.
