## Notes

- American democracy has been classified during Trumps office as annocratic.
- It has many undemocratic elements like the Electoral College, the Filibuster rule, and Gerrymandering
- The parties are responsible for the organisation of the elections. They get to count the votes as well 
- With Joe Bidens presidency, the United States still passes as a democracy 
 
- The votes of white people have seen a development. Before Obama there were as many votes for the Republicans as well as for the democrats. After Obama many white people transitioned to the republicans.
- In the face of not being the majority in their country, many white people feel frightened. So they vote for the party that represents their ethnicity. 
- The lost of hope. A phenomena that occurs when a party looses and as a reaction, they lie.



## Speech 

Ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to address the findings of civil war researcher Barbara F. Walter,  on the possible causes that weaken democracy in our nation. 

Today, I will outline these findings and shed light on the implications they have our the state of democracy.

Firstly, it is noteworthy to mention that American democracy has been classified as annocratic during the office of President Trump. 

This classification highlights the presence of undemocratic elements within the system. For instance, the Electoral College, the Filibuster rule, and Gerrymandering are all mechanisms that have been criticized for potentially undermining the democratic process.

Additionally, one alarming aspect is that political parties in the United States are responsible for organizing elections and counting votes. 

This concentration of power raises concerns about the fairness and integrity of the electoral process.

Despite these challenges, it is crucial to acknowledge that the United States, under President Biden's leadership, still passes as a democracy, so hope still lives on.

But another significant finding of the researcher.

One we should be truly aware of is the shift in voting patterns among white Americans. 

Before President Obama's office, there was a relatively balanced distribution of votes between Republicans and Democrats. 

**However**, after his presidency, a substantial number of white voters transitioned to the Republican Party. 

This phenomenon may come form the insecurity among white individuals who are not the majority in their country can influence their voting preferences. This fear may lead them to align with a political party that they perceive as representing their ethnicity.

**For us democrats,** it is essential to recognize and address these concerns to ensure inclusivity and strengthen democratic values.

Lastly, the loss of the *hope*,  defined by civil war researcher Barbara L. Walter, can significantly impact the democratic process. 

When a political party experiences a loss, there is a risk of falling back to lies and misinformation as a reaction. This erosion of truth and trust,  challenges the foundations of democracy, as it undermines the transparency and accountability necessary for a healthy political system.
 

My fellow democratsâ€¦ 

Only by acknowledging and tackling these causes can we ensure a strong and vibrant democracy for future generations, for democrats and republicans alike .

Thank you.
