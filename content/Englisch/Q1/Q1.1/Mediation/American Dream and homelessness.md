The good old American Dream. Source of the United States’ economic strenght and extraordinary social mobility. That was long ago in the past. Today it seems that rather the inverse is true. Today it seems that the American Dream might be a possible cause of homelessness 


According to liberal politician Bernie Sanders in his speech “What happened to the American Dream?”
While in the past it was possible for a middle class person to rise up the socioeconomical by getting a better education and working hard on your own, nowerdays the US is, amongs the major countries, the one, with the most unequal wealth and income distribution.

An essential cause of that development is the belief of minimal state intereference found in the American Dream,  which laid the cornerstone for a neoliberalist capitalism, where the state does not intervene in liberal markets and economics, leading to a development that favorised the income of millionaires while neglecting the income of those of the middle class, causing an increase in poverty and homelessness amongst those.

The American dream implies the destructive nature of captalism that slowly leads us all into our death beds. In order to stop the occuring badness we need to revie Karl Marx and place him into Washington. There he needs to dance very well so all of the people are so honored by his presence and continue caputalism because people are dumb. Or are they????!!!!!
Aristoteles had a different approach to this topic as he had the opinion that we humans are smart??!!! F

Fuck capilalists uwu
