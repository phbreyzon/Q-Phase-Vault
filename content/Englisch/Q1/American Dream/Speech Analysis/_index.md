## Note on figures of speech and rhetorical devices

Rhetorical devices and figures of speech are related concepts but not exactly the same thing. 

Rhetorical devices are techniques or strategies used in speaking or writing to effectively communicate and persuade an audience. They are tools that enhance the impact and effectiveness of communication. Rhetorical devices can include figures of speech, but they also encompass other techniques such as repetition, parallelism, hyperbole, irony, and more. Rhetorical devices are broader and encompass a wider range of techniques used in persuasive communication.

On the other hand, figures of speech are specific forms or patterns of language that depart from the ordinary or literal meaning of words. They are used to adding richness, depth, and creativity to language. Figures of speech can be seen as a subset of rhetorical devices, as they are specific ways of using language to create imaginative or vivid expressions. Examples of figures of speech include metaphors, similes, personification, hyperbole, and alliteration.

In summary, figures of speech are specific types of language usage within the broader category of rhetorical devices.

6. Conclusion 
   
Today, I stand before you to shed light on a dark chapter of American history that continues to shape our modern age: the impact of slavery in the United States. Slavery, a system that spanned centuries, has left an indelible mark on our society, economy, and collective consciousness.

First and foremost, the legacy of slavery is evident in the persistent racial inequalities that exist today. Slavery laid the foundation for systemic racism, perpetuating discrimination, prejudice, and unequal treatment based on skin color. It created a racial hierarchy that continues to affect access to education, employment opportunities, housing, and the criminal justice system.
