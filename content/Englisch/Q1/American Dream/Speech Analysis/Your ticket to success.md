## The speech

I know that sometimes you get that sense from TV that you can be rich and successful without any, hard work — that your ticket to success is through rapping or basketball or being a reality TV star. Chances are you're not going to be any of those things. The truth is, being successful is hard. [...] Some of the most successful people in the world are the ones 5 who've had the most failures. J.K. Rowling — who wrote Harry Potter— her first Harry Potter book was rejected i 2 times before it was finally published. Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team. He lost hundreds of games and missed thousands of shots during his career. But he once said, "I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that's why I succeed." 

These people succeeded because they understood that you can't let your failures define you — you have to 10 let your failures teach you. You have to let them show you what to do differently the next time. So if you get into trouble, that doesn't mean you're a troublemaker, it means you need to try harder to act right. If you get a bad grade, that doesn't mean you're stupid, it just means you need to spend more time studying. 


No one's born being good at all things. You become good at things through hard work. You're not a varsity athlete the first time you play a new sport. You don't hit every note the first time you sing a song. You've got 15 to practice. The same principle applies to your schoolwork. You might have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right. You might have to read something a few times before you understand it. You definitely have to do a few drafts of a paper before it's good enough to hand in. 

Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. I do that every day. Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength because it shows you have the courage to admit when 20 you don't know something, and that then allows you to learn something new So find an adult that you trust — a parent, a grandparent or teacher, a coach or a counselor — and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals. 

And even when you're struggling, even when you're discouraged, and you feel like other people have given up on you, don't ever give up on yourself, because when you give up on yourself, you give up on your 25 country. The story of America isn't about people who Quit when things got tough. It's about people who kept going, who tried harder, who loved their country too much to do anything less than their best



### Notes
- Introductory sentence contains the use of personal pronouns (you) that help establish an initial connection between the speaker and the audience. Additionally, the use of everyday language reinforces the connection and makes it very easy for the audience to understand what is being spoken. 
-  Transition from the introductory paragraph to the first contains a contrast between the seemingly popular way of becoming successful and the actual reality.

- A contrast as well at line (4-5), that relates to the one previously. This time it emphasizes the fact that while the mainstream approach is coined by the successes of the individual, in reality the biggest of successes came at a lot of cost of many failures down the road. Naming J.K. Rowling and Michael Jordan, both being very popular and successful individuals who influenced the mainstream culture and therefore makes the contrast much more relatable.

- Makes a transition back to the audience. 
- He uses the personal pronounce in order to make a more direct demand, instead of simply talking to the audience in general. While doing so he firstly uses one of his commonly used rhetorical strategy, which can be described as a funnel-like way to mention topics, by starting in this example with a rather abstract advice *(you can’t let your failures define you)*, and ending with the advice evolving through similar structured sentences into the point that is intended to be the most impactful, which in this example the abstract demand  translates into *(quoting line 12: that (the failure) doesn’t mean you’re stupid, it just means you need to spend more time studying.)* ,after as series of similar sentences.
  
- The introductory sentence into the third paragraph compactly summarizes the key ideas that Obama wants to deliver. 
- continues on demanding the audience, again using his funnel-like technique by firstly talking about the commitment required for success in the personal area and transitioning back to the commitment required in the academical field.

- In the next paragraph he continues to give advice, but this time it 

- In the next paragraph 
### Main message

- Attainment of personal success for the individual through hard work.
- Hard work will simultaneously leads to a better economy, which is the hidden intention.


## The analysis 

The speech titled “your ticket to success”, delivered by Barack Obama on September 2009 and geared towards the American children, is a speech that effectively conveys the message of hard work and perseverance leading to success. Tailored specifically to the American audience, the speech engages the young listeners by addressing common misconceptions about achieving success and emphasizing the importance of resilience and determination.

The speech begins with a statement that immediately captures the audience's attention. The speaker acknowledges that media often portrays shortcuts to success, but counters this notion by emphasizing the difficulty of achieving success. By referencing real-life examples such as J.K. Rowling and Michael Jordan, the speaker establishes credibility and demonstrates that even highly successful individuals faced failures and setbacks.

Throughout the two following paragraphs, Obama encourages the audience not to be defined by their failures but to learn from them. 
He uses the personal pronounce in order to make a more direct demand, instead of simply talking to the audience in general. 
While doing so he firstly uses one of his commonly used rhetorical strategies, which can be described as a funnel-like way of tackling certain topics, by starting in this example with a rather abstract advice *(you can’t let your failures define you)*, and then evolving that advice through similar structured sentences into the point that is intended to be the most impactful, which in this example the advice translates into *(quoting line 12: that (the failure) doesn’t mean you’re stupid, it just means you need to spend more time studying.)* , after as series of similar sentences. 
By using relatable examples like getting into trouble or receiving a bad grade, the speaker reassures the audience that setbacks do not determine their worth or potential. 

In the next paragraph, the speaker emphasizes the importance of seeking help and asking questions. By sharing their own experience of seeking help daily, the speaker normalizes the act of asking for assistance and presents it as a sign of strength rather than weakness, which encourages the audience to reach out to trusted adults for guidance and support.

Finally, the speech concludes with a patriotic message, reminding the audience not to give up on themselves or their country. By referring to the story of America and its history, Obama contributes to the development of a sense of national pride and motivates the young audience to persevere and aligning their personal success with the success of their country.
Here again, the funnel-like strategy is being used by first talking about the importance of the individual effort and concluding on how this impacts the whole nation, which on the one hand gives the actions of the individual a seemingly big importance, and makes the relation to the bigger picture much easier to relate to on the other hand. 


In conclusion, the speech effectively conveys the message of hard work, resilience, and the importance of seeking help. Tailored to the American context, the speech utilizes relatable examples, patriotic appeals, and successfully creates the image of Obama as a credible speaker to engage the audience and motivate them to persevere on their path to success, which surely can
