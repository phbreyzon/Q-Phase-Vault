#### Write one parapgrah answering the question “why school shooting happen according to the song” don’t forget to start your paragraph with a topic sentence

The song, youth of the Nation, deals with school shootings in the united states and indirectly gives insight on potential reasons why school shootings happen in the first place. 
According to the song, the reason in this specific case, are unexpressed feelings, while being trapped in a situation influenced by many factors that didn’t encourage open communication with anyone about potential problems. Johnny, the perpetrator is described as a loner with no friends and who seems to lack  respect for social ties. Although he’s always tried to be the school clown, he never belonged to any group within school. 
It is very likely the case, that other factors such as family issues as well as other external factors had an impact on Jonny’s decision on walking amog to school, but they’re not mentioned in the text.
