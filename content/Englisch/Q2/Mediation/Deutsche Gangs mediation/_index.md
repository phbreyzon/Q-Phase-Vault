### Key factors

1. **Rootlessness and Disappointment**: The sense of being uprooted and the subsequent disappointment with unmet expectations in the host country are profound. Families like Yeyha's, which initially fled violence seeking safety and prosperity, find themselves marginalized.

2. **Lack of Legal Status and Work Opportunities**: Yeyha, like many others, holds only a "tolerated" status in Germany, which restricts his ability to work, pursue education, or even partake in local competitions, despite his talents in boxing. This lack of opportunity and legal recognition fuels frustration and disillusionment.

3. **Social Exclusion and Stigmatization**: The societal exclusion and the constant reminder that they are not welcome pushes individuals towards environments where they feel accepted, even if that acceptance comes from criminal gangs.

4. **Use of New Arrivals by Established Clans**: The article highlights how established Arab clans exploit newly arrived migrants for their criminal activities, initially involving them in low-level crimes like hashish sales. This not only provides the clans with a workforce but also traps these newcomers in a cycle of criminality.

5. **Pressure to Succeed and Support Families**: Many young migrants bear the weight of their families' expectations to succeed and often become the primary hope for their relatives back home. The pressure to support their families financially can push them towards illegal means of earning when legal avenues are closed off.


## Task

Dear Team,

As we delve into our project on understanding why some young adults with migratory backgrounds are drawn to criminal gangs, I came across an enlightening article that sheds light on several underlying causes. I believe it's crucial for our research to consider these aspects to better comprehend the complexities these individuals face.

The article discusses the struggle of migrant families in Berlin, particularly focusing on a neighborhood known as Neukölln, which has become notorious for its association with heavy and organized crime. 

The article delves into the intersection of migration, lack of opportunities, and systemic failures that contribute to the phenomenon. 
Many refugees, including a significant number from Arabic countries, arrive with hopes for a better life but face immediate obstacles. Yeyha’s story, the one of an immigrant there, exemplifies this, that despite his potential, legal and societal barriers prevented him from pursuing education or employment, pushing him into a life of crime as a means of survival and assertion of identity.

But most importantly, the article  further explores how established Arab clans exploit the vulnerability of new arrivals, drawing them into criminal activities as a means of survival. The lack of integration programs, combined with the pressure to support their families back home, leaves these young individuals susceptible to the allure of quick financial gains through illicit means. 

Moreover, the article highlights the psychological impact of these challenges. The constant struggle for acceptance, coupled with the inability to pursue education or meaningful employment, cultivates resentment and a feeling of hopelessness. For some, joining a gang becomes not just a path to financial stability but also a desire for identity and respect within their community.

As we continue our research, it's crucial to consider these multifaceted issues that drive young migrants towards criminality. 

Your thoughts and insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
