## Text 

Dear attendee, 
The global trade market has impacted the way nations operate drastically. According to the online Article “Produktionsstandort Europa: Neue Chancen für den alten Kontinent” a trend to relocate the production of goods locally, which in our case would be the continent of europe, has become increasingly more and important. After seeing in times of crisis how vulnerable and dependent our trade system is, the tendency towards outsorcing production costs by producing goods in low-wage-countries has shifted, concentrating towards faster and  more reliable trading systems although being much expensive than the alternative. 
Was this insight of any use, if so, let’s discuss that.
