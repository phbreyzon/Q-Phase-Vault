- Coherent problem 
- unbalanced situation 
- potential solution 

As  we make further progress as a global society, we also need to keep in mind that progress comes at a cost of ressources. Unfortunately, our planet has a limited amount of those ressources, and while we continue to progress, we simultaneously use more natural ressources without thinking about building sustainable systems of consumption, which will ultimately lead to catastrophic consequences for us and our planet if we don’t get off our asses. 

However, our situation isn’t completely hopeless, countries such as France, Germany and Spain have already adopted the so-called Circular economy framework, an economical concept that reduces the impact on the environment.  And this isn’t something exclusive to  first-world countries. Columbia launched a similar policy in 2019 and China’s ban of waste export encourages a more substainable economy. Of course there’s still a lot to be done but at least its a start.
