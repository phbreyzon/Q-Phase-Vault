### Infos from the text “Es ist gut für die armen, dass die Reichen reich sind” 
- Published under the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
- The poor countries benefit from the fact that rich countries are as rich because rich countries develop the new technologies, which can be taken over by poor countries .
- Fabrics on which underpayed workers labor, are an opportunity for those workers who would otherwise suffer from extreme poverty. 
- For a poor country an export based growth economy is recommended, like many asian countries such as south Korea and China. 
- Poor countries are able to grow faster than rich ones
- they have higher percentage of growth compared to richer countries, even though that does not correspond to a higher outcome of that growth. 
- Child labour was a reality in rich countries as well which has diminished with the help of econommical growth.
- Nevertheless it is a natural desire to immigrate into richer countries in order to profit from a higher living-standard
