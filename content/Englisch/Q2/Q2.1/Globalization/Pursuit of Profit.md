## Tasks 

- Severe threats to human health (air pollution)
- Eating too much processed and red meat is bad + responsible for 14.5% of the global greenhouse emissions because animals like to fart a lot 


- Capitalistic econmies and democratic system go hand-in-hand, since the politics provide a system of checks and balances. Their interests have to be independent from each other. 
- In reality there is a correlation of interest between those two 
- Democracies develop into oligarchies, where powerful economic elites and organised groups influence the decisions done in politics while citizens have little power on the countryâ€™s policies.
