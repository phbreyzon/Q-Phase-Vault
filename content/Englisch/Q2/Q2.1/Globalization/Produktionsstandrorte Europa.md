## Text 

Dear attendees, 
The global trade market has impacted the way nations operate economically in a drastic way. According to the online Article titled: “Produktionsstandort Europa: Neue Chancen für den alten Kontinent”, published by Simon book in the Spiegel on 23 July 2021,  a trend to relocate the production of goods locally, which in our case would be the continent of europe, has become increasingly more important recently.

After seeing in times of crisis how vulnerable and dependent our trade system is, the tendency towards outsorcing production costs by producing goods in low-wage-countries has shifted, concentrating towards faster and  more reliable trading systems despite being much more expensive than the alternative. 

I hope this information was useful, if so, let’s discuss that.
