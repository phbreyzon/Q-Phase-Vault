#### Commenting on the cartoon 

The cartoon contrasts problems faced by American society when it comes to the ligitimacy of the second amendment in the US. 

Hereby the second amendment, which allows american citizens to bear arms, is being put into comparison with its original conception, namely with the on  defined by the founding fathers and with the perception that is rather more modern and reflets its practicallity today. 

While the founding fathers originally intended the second amendment as a right that prevented undemocratic governments, today it is being abused by lobbies such as the NRA to purely profit from the sales of guns, without been concerned about the disregulation arround guns. They are responsible for making the US one of the countries with the biggest gun homocidal and suicide rate around the world. 


#### Should guns be more strictly regulated in America? Conduct a panel discussion with 

- A representative of the NRA 
- A member of the NGO Moms Demand Action 
- A Journalist from Germany (see Erfurt of Winnenden school shootings )
  
### Panel Discussion on Gun Regulation in America

#### Participants:
- **NRA Representative:**
  - Guns are a fundamental right protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
  - Stricter regulations infringe upon the rights of law-abiding citizens to bear arms for self-defense and sport.
  - The focus should be on enforcing existing laws rather than creating new ones that burden responsible gun owners.
  - Guns scare criminals off
  - Citizens can defenend themselves 
  - The supreme court supports our point

- **Mental health and criminal activity:** The NRA representative may point out that the focus should be on addressing mental health issues and preventing criminal activity, rather than implementing stricter gun laws. They may argue that responsible gun owners should not be penalized for the actions of a few 
- individuals who misuse firearms.
- guns arenâ€™t the problem, bad people are 
- 
- **Moms Demand Action Member:**
  - Stricter gun regulations are necessary to reduce gun violence and protect public safety.
  - Background checks and waiting periods can help prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands.
  - Common-sense gun laws are essential for preventing tragedies like school shootings and mass shootings in America.

- **Journalist from Germany:**
  - Referencing the Erfurt and Winnenden school shootings in Germany, stricter gun regulations can prevent similar tragedies.
  - Germany has implemented comprehensive gun control measures that have contributed to lower rates of gun violence.
  - Learning from the experiences of other countries can guide the U.S. in adopting effective gun control policies to ensure public safety.
