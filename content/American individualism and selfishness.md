In a world where communal values often reign supreme, the concept of individualism has long been regarded with skepticism. Yet, social researcher Abigail Marsh is challenging these preconceived notions, revealing a fascinating connection between individualism and altruism.

According to her research individualism, when embraced, has the power to psychologically liberate individuals and foster a more universalist outlook. 

What it means in detail is that people shaped by individualist cultures tend to pursue and attain their individual life goals more often, than for example in more collectivist cultures. And since life satisfaction is commonly found in helping people, it results in individualist cultures having greater amounts of altruism. Additionally research shows that being altruistic causes greater feelings of personal well-being, encouraging an individual to engage in even more altruistic activities, creation a so-called “virtuous circle”. 

Secondly, the increased universalist outlook, which refers to a perspective or belief system that emphasizes the commonalities, and shared values among all individuals and cultures regardless of differences in religion, social background or nation, comes from the very simple fact, that individualism, as the name implies, prioritizes the rights and well-being of the individual being. 
More prezisely, by placing the importance on the individual it simultaneously de-emphasizises group differences, reducing the tendency to be less generous towards those who are outside of one's immediate circle.
